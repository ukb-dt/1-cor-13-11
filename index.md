**[14:41]** Amen!

**[14:42]** These are young Burundi youth in French Canada
*(Edited 14:42)*

**[14:42]** Channeling Lingala like the Congolese in Belgium

**[14:45]** And some of my favorite verses from the Bible follow:

12 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.

13 And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.

**[14:45]** Adults are pessimistic

**[14:45]** Children? Optimistic

**[14:45]** Jesus always described children as the true heirs of the kingdom

**[14:36]** Great, great somewhat new song from Burundi

**[14:39]** *When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things*

**[14:39]** — 1 Cor 13:11

**[14:39]** The childish things on my mind is the seamless ability to grasp all languages

**[14:40]** This song opens with "Burya umugisha utangwa n'Imana"

**[14:41]** From my childish perspective, it's simply "Buli omukisa guva-wa katonda"

**[14:41]** Katonda = Owa Mani = Imani = God

**Lucy Muzaale [14:41]** I am listening to it and also following in English.

*(Note: Typos and formatting preserved as appearing in the screenshot, e.g., “Burundi youth” likely means “Burundian youth”; “Congoleseese” and “Belguim” as shown. Bible verses from 1 Corinthians 13:12-13, KJV translation. The conversation appears to reference listening to something—possibly audio/podcast in French with English subtitles—featuring Burundian youth channeling Lingala music/styles, akin to Congolese diaspora in Belgium.)*

*(Note: Typos preserved as in screenshot, e.g., “Remdemption” likely “Redemption”; “Burundii” for “Burundi”; “spake” archaic from KJV Bible. This appears to continue the previous chat’s theme—Burundian youth/music (possibly gospel/redemption song in Kirundi) and 1 Corinthians 13:11: “When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child…”. The video link points to a Burundian gospel track by artists like “Turikuvuga Imana” or similar, based on lyrics/themes of gratitude and praise.)*
